## Console Debugging

### Good Console Output:
```
[Agent] NEW MESSAGE: build me an ai voice
[IntentAnalyzer] Quick detection for: build me an ai voice
[IntentAnalyzer] ‚úì Matched build pattern
[Agent] Intent type: project_generation
[Agent] ‚Üí Handling as PROJECT GENERATION
[Agent] ‚úì Matched TTS template
[Desktop Control] Opening File Explorer
[Desktop Control] Opening VSCode
[Desktop Control] Opening Browser
```

### If Not Working:
Check these lines in console:
```
[IntentAnalyzer] Has voice keyword: true  ‚úÖ
[IntentAnalyzer] Has build keyword: true  ‚úÖ
```

Both should be `true` for voice requests.

**Generated Project:**

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Agent doesn't recognize "build me an ai voice"
**Solution:** Check intent-analyzer.ts console output for pattern matching

### Problem: VSCode or Browser doesn't open
**Solution:** Check visual-builder.ts event logs

### Problem: Voice doesn't speak in browser
**Solution:** 
- Try Chrome/Edge (best Web Speech API support)
- Check browser permissions for audio
- Try a different voice from dropdown
