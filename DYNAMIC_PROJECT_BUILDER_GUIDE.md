# Dynamic Project Builder - Build Literally Anything! 🚀

## Overview

Your AI Desktop Agent can now build **literally any application** you ask for in chat! The system uses advanced AI to understand your requirements and generate complete, working applications.

## What Changed

### Before ❌
- Limited to 2 templates: Calculator and TTS Voice
- Could only build pre-defined projects
- No flexibility for custom requests

### After ✅
- **Build literally anything** you can imagine
- AI-powered dynamic code generation
- Supports multiple technologies
- Creates complete, production-ready applications
- Opens everything visually on your desktop

## How It Works

1. **You describe** what you want to build in natural language
2. **AI analyzes** your requirements
3. **AI generates** complete code for your application
4. **System builds** the project visually on your desktop
5. **Everything opens** automatically (VSCode + Browser/App)

## Limitations

While the system is very powerful, keep in mind:

- **No external accounts**: Won't create accounts or deploy to servers
- **Local only**: Projects run on your computer
- **API keys**: You'll need to provide your own API keys for external services
- **Complexity**: Very complex enterprise apps might need refinement
- **Database**: Simple projects use localStorage; complex ones might need setup

## Troubleshooting

### If a build fails:
1. Try rephrasing your request
2. Break complex requests into simpler parts
3. Specify the technology you want
4. Check the error message for details

### If the app doesn't look right:
1. Refresh the browser
2. Check VSCode for the code
3. Modify the CSS for your preferences
4. Ask the AI to rebuild with specific changes

## Examples to Try Right Now

Copy and paste these into chat:

1. `Build me a weather app with a 5-day forecast`
2. `Create a simple task manager with local storage`
3. `Make a stopwatch with lap times`
4. `Build a markdown editor with live preview`
5. `Create a color palette generator`
6. `Make a quote generator with random quotes`
7. `Build a expense tracker app`
8. `Create a countdown timer for events`
9. `Make a habit tracking app`
10. `Build a recipe organizer`
