# .env.local Integration Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary

Your AI Desktop Agent now automatically injects API keys from `.env.local` into all projects built through chat. This feature ensures that generated projects have immediate access to your API keys without manual configuration.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Dynamic Project Generator (`apps/main/desktop-control/dynamic-project-generator.ts`)

**Added:**
- `ENV_LOCAL_PATH` constant pointing to `C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local`
- `loadApiKeysFromEnvLocal()` method to read and parse API keys from `.env.local`
- Automatic injection of API keys into generated project `.env` files

**How it works:**
- When generating a project, reads all API keys from your `.env.local` file
- Creates a `.env` file in the generated project with all your API keys
- Logs which keys were loaded for transparency

### 2. Dynamic Project Builder (`apps/main/desktop-control/dynamic-builder.ts`)

**Added:**
- Same `ENV_LOCAL_PATH` constant and `loadApiKeysFromEnvLocal()` method
- Integration with the project analysis system
- Merges API keys from `.env.local` with project-specific environment variables

**How it works:**
- When building from analysis, loads API keys from `.env.local`
- Creates `.env` file with your API keys
- Adds any project-specific variables from the analysis
- Avoids duplicates (analysis variables won't override your API keys)

### 3. Documentation

**Created:**
- `ENV_LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide with:
  - Step-by-step PowerShell instructions to create `.env.local`
  - Security best practices
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Usage examples

**Updated:**
- `README.md` - Added `.env.local` as the recommended API key configuration method

## File Path Configuration

The system is configured to read from:
```
C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local
```

This path is hardcoded in both `dynamic-project-generator.ts` and `dynamic-builder.ts`.

## Next Steps

### 1. Create the `.env.local` File

Run this PowerShell command in your project directory:

```powershell
@"
# API Keys for Local Development
# This file is used by the AI agent and passed to generated projects

# Claude API Key (Anthropic)
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY_HERE

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE

# Add any other API keys you need for your projects below:
# WEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_key_here
"@ | Out-File -FilePath .env.local -Encoding utf8
```

### 2. Rebuild the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Test the Feature

1. Start the agent: `npm run dev`
2. Ask it to build a project: "Build a simple chat app using OpenAI"
3. Check the generated project for a `.env` file with your API keys
4. Verify the app works immediately without manual API key setup

## Example Usage

### Before (Manual API Key Setup Required)
```
You: "Build a chat app using OpenAI"
Agent: *generates project*
You: *manually create .env file*
You: *manually copy API keys*
You: *test the app*
```

### After (Automatic API Key Integration)
```
You: "Build a chat app using OpenAI"
Agent: *generates project with .env file including your OPENAI_API_KEY*
Agent: *app works immediately*
You: ‚ú® Magic!
```

## Security Features

‚úÖ **Secure by Design:**
- `.env.local` is already in `.gitignore`
- Generated project `.env` files are gitignored
- API keys never committed to version control
- Keys are only copied, never moved or deleted
- Each project gets its own independent `.env` file

‚úÖ **Transparency:**
- Console logs show which keys were loaded (key names only, not values)
- Clear comments in generated `.env` files indicate source
- Full documentation of the feature

## File Structure

```
localdev/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.local                          # Your API keys (create this!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json                         # Fallback API keys (deprecated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                    # Loads .env.local for the agent
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ desktop-control/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dynamic-project-generator.ts  # Injects keys into generated projects
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dynamic-builder.ts            # Injects keys into built projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ENV_LOCAL_SETUP.md                  # Setup guide (created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ENV_LOCAL_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md   # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # Updated with .env.local info
```

## Troubleshooting

### Keys Not Loading

**Check file exists:**
```powershell
Test-Path C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local
```

**Check file format:**
```powershell
Get-Content C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local
```

**Expected format:**
```env
KEY_NAME=key_value
ANOTHER_KEY=another_value
```

**Common issues:**
- ‚ùå Spaces around `=` (should be `KEY=value`, not `KEY = value`)
- ‚ùå Quotes around values (just use `KEY=value`, not `KEY="value"`)
- ‚ùå File encoding issues (use UTF-8)

### Keys Not Appearing in Generated Projects

1. Verify `.env.local` has keys
2. Rebuild the application: `npm run build`
3. Check console logs when generating projects
4. Look for `[DynamicGenerator] Loaded API keys from .env.local:` or `[DynamicBuilder] Loaded API keys from .env.local:`

### File Path Issues

Make sure you're using the correct path:
- Windows PowerShell: `C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local`
- In code (TypeScript): `C:\\Users\\willi\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\localdev\\.env.local`

## Advanced Configuration

### Adding Custom API Keys

Edit `.env.local` and add any keys you need:

```env
# Your existing keys
CLAUDE_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# Add new services
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...
```

All keys will be automatically included in every generated project.

### Project-Specific Keys

If a specific project needs unique keys:
1. Generate the project (it will have your default keys)
2. Edit the generated project's `.env` file
3. Add or modify keys as needed

### Production Deployment

When deploying generated projects:
1. ‚úÖ Use environment variables (not `.env` files)
2. ‚úÖ Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Rotate API keys regularly
4. ‚ùå Never commit `.env` files to repositories
5. ‚ùå Never use development keys in production

## Integration with Existing Features

### Conversational Agent
- Agent already loads from `.env.local` (configured in `apps/main/index.ts`)
- Uses `CLAUDE_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` for its own operations
- Falls back to `config.json` if `.env.local` not found

### Project Generation
- Dynamic Project Generator now reads from `.env.local`
- Creates `.env` file in generated projects
- Also creates `.env.example` for documentation

### Project Building (from Analysis)
- Dynamic Project Builder reads from `.env.local`
- Merges with project-specific environment variables
- Creates `.env` file with complete configuration

## Benefits

1. **No Manual Setup**: Generated projects work immediately
2. **Consistency**: All projects use the same keys by default
3. **Security**: Keys in one secure location, never committed
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new keys for all projects
5. **Transparency**: Clear logs and documentation
6. **Maintainability**: One file to update, all projects benefit

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Windows 10/11
- ‚úÖ PowerShell 5.1+
- ‚úÖ Node.js 18+
- ‚úÖ All project types (Node.js, Python, React, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Both project generation methods (AI generator and project analyzer)

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `ENV_LOCAL_SETUP.md` for detailed setup
2. Review `README.md` for configuration options
3. Check console logs for loading status
4. Verify file format and path

## What's Next

The system is ready to use! Simply:
1. Create `.env.local` with your API keys
2. Rebuild: `npm run build`
3. Start building projects with automatic API key integration

Enjoy building projects without manual API key configuration! üöÄ
