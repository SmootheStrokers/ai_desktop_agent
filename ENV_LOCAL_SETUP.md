# .env.local Setup for Project Generation

## Overview

Your AI agent has been configured to automatically inject API keys from `.env.local` into all projects built through chat. This ensures your generated projects have immediate access to necessary API keys without manual configuration.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create the `.env.local` File

Create a file at: `C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local`

You can do this via PowerShell:

```powershell
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev

# Create the .env.local file with your API keys
@"
# API Keys for Local Development
# This file is used by the AI agent and passed to generated projects

# Claude API Key (Anthropic)
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY_HERE

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE

# Add any other API keys you need for your projects below:
# WEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_key_here
# FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key_here
"@ | Out-File -FilePath .env.local -Encoding utf8
```

### Step 2: Verify the File

Check that the file was created successfully:

```powershell
# Check if file exists
Test-Path .env.local

# View the contents (be careful - this contains secrets!)
Get-Content .env.local
```

### Step 3: Secure the File

The `.env.local` file is already added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing your API keys to version control.

**Important Security Notes:**
- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (already configured)
- ✅ API keys are loaded from this file by the agent
- ✅ Generated projects receive a copy of your API keys in their own `.env` file
- ⚠️ Never commit this file to version control
- ⚠️ Each generated project will have its own `.env` file (also gitignored)

## How It Works

When you prompt the AI agent to build a project:

1. The agent reads API keys from `C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local`
2. It generates the project files according to your request
3. It automatically creates a `.env` file in the new project with all your API keys
4. The generated project can immediately use these keys without additional configuration

### Example Usage

**You:** "Build a chat app that uses OpenAI's API"

**Agent:** 
- ✅ Generates the project structure
- ✅ Creates a `.env` file with your `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env.local`
- ✅ Configures the project to load from `.env`
- ✅ The app works immediately without manual API key setup

## Adding New API Keys

To add new API keys that will be available to all generated projects:

1. Edit `C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local`
2. Add your new key in the format: `KEY_NAME=key_value`
3. Save the file
4. All future projects will automatically include this key

Example:
```env
# Weather API
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key_here

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb

# Payment Processing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_key
```

## Modified Files

The following files have been updated to support this feature:

- `apps/main/desktop-control/dynamic-project-generator.ts` - Loads and injects API keys
- `apps/main/desktop-control/dynamic-builder.ts` - Loads and injects API keys
- `apps/main/index.ts` - Already configured to load from `.env.local` for the agent itself

## Troubleshooting

### API Keys Not Appearing in Generated Projects

1. Verify `.env.local` exists at the correct path:
   ```powershell
   Test-Path C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local
   ```

2. Check the file format (each line should be `KEY=value`, no spaces around `=`):
   ```powershell
   Get-Content C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local
   ```

3. Restart the AI agent after creating/modifying `.env.local`

### File Not Found Error

Make sure the path uses double backslashes in the code but single backslashes in PowerShell:
- PowerShell: `C:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\localdev\.env.local`
- Code: `C:\\Users\\willi\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\localdev\\.env.local`

## Security Best Practices

1. ✅ Use `.env.local` for local development only
2. ✅ Use environment variables or secret managers for production
3. ✅ Never commit `.env.local` or generated project `.env` files
4. ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
5. ✅ Use different keys for development and production
6. ✅ Limit API key permissions to minimum required

## Next Steps

1. Create the `.env.local` file using the PowerShell commands above
2. Build your first project: "Build a simple weather app"
3. Verify the generated project has a `.env` file with your keys
4. Start building without manual API key configuration!
